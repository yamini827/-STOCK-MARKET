**ðŸ“Š Stock Price Forecasting Project â€“ README**

**1. Introduction:-**

Stock price forecasting is a crucial task for investors, analysts, and businesses aiming to predict market movements. This project applies time series forecasting methods â€” ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM deep learning models â€” to predict the closing prices of multiple companies like Amazon, Google, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft.

The project includes:

**Data preprocessing:-**

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Forecasting using statistical models

Forecasting using deep learning

Comparative analysis of results

**2. Dataset Overview:-**

The dataset contains historical stock prices with the following key columns:

Date â€“ The trading date

Open, High, Low, Close â€“ Stock price details

Volume â€“ Number of shares traded

Separate sheets/columns for Amazon, Google, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft

Data Source: Provided Excel file (stocks.xlsx).

**3. Data Preprocessing:-**

Before modeling, the dataset is cleaned and transformed:

**3.1 Handling Missing Values:-**

Check for NaNs in price columns

Fill missing values using forward fill (ffill) or interpolation

**3.2 Date Formatting:-**

Convert Date to datetime format

Set Date as the DataFrame index for time series operations

**3.3 Filtering Columns:-**

Select only Date and Close columns for forecasting

Extract each companyâ€™s data separately

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-**

Visual insights help understand the data patterns.

**4.1 Line Plot of Closing Prices:-**

Show price trends over time for each company

**4.2 Moving Averages:-**

Plot 20-day and 50-day moving averages to observe trends

**4.3 Seasonal Decomposition:-**

Break the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components

**4.4 Correlation Analysis:-**

Check relationships between different companiesâ€™ stock prices

**5. Forecasting Models:-**

**5.1 ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**

ARIMA(p,d,q):

p: Autoregressive terms

d: Differencing for stationarity

q: Moving average terms

Works well for non-seasonal time series

Steps:

Test stationarity (ADF Test)

Apply differencing if needed

Choose parameters using AIC/BIC

Fit the model and forecast

**5.2 SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):-**

SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q,s):

Adds seasonal components to ARIMA

s is seasonal period (e.g., 12 for monthly)

Ideal for seasonal trends in stock prices

Steps:

Identify seasonality

Fit SARIMA with seasonal parameters

Compare with ARIMA performance

**5.3 Prophet (by Meta/Facebook):-**

Handles seasonality, trend changes, and holidays

Requires DataFrame with ds (date) and y (value)

Pros:

Automatic seasonality detection

Handles missing data and outliers well

Steps:

Rename columns to ds and y

Fit Prophet model

Forecast and visualize components

**5.4 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):-**

Deep learning model designed for sequence prediction

Can learn long-term dependencies in data

Steps:

Scale data using MinMaxScaler

Create sequences for LSTM input

Define LSTM layers in Keras/TensorFlow

Train and evaluate

Advantage: Captures complex nonlinear patterns

**6. Visualizations for Models:-**

For each model:

Historical vs. Forecast Plot
Show actual and predicted prices

Residual Plot
Check if errors are randomly distributed

Confidence Intervals
Display uncertainty in forecasts

Training vs. Validation Performance
For LSTM, plot loss curves

**7. Model Comparison:-**

Evaluate models using:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

Create a table comparing ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM

Discuss:

Which model performed best for short-term forecasts

Which model captured long-term trends better

**8. Key Observations:-**

ARIMA works well for stable, non-seasonal trends.

SARIMA is better when there is clear seasonality.

Prophet is robust to missing data and provides clear interpretability.

LSTM handles complex nonlinear patterns but requires more data and tuning.

**9. Possible Improvements:-**

Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV or Bayesian optimization

Ensemble forecasting (combine multiple models)

Incorporate external data like news sentiment or economic indicators

Try Transformer-based forecasting models (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformer)

**10. Conclusion:-**

This project demonstrates the full cycle of time series forecasting for stock prices, comparing traditional statistical models with modern machine learning and deep learning approaches.
It highlights that no single model is universally best â€” performance depends on data characteristics, forecast horizon, and the complexity of trends and seasonality.
